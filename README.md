# Mars Rover Coding Kata

## Description

The Mars Rover Kata is a coding challenge that simulates the movement of a rover on the surface of Mars. The rover can move in four directions (North, East, South, and West) and can be commanded to move forward or turn left/right. The goal is to implement a system that can interpret commands and update the rover's position accordingly.

## Basic Requirements

1. The rover starts at a given position on a grid (e.g., 0,0).
2. The rover can be commanded to move forward (M) or turn left (L) or right (R).
3. The rover should be able to wrap around the grid (e.g., moving off one edge brings it back on the opposite edge).
4. The rover's position and orientation should be printed after each command.
